# Introduction

*This is still a work in progress and only presented here for the purposes of receiving feedback. This message will be removed when the Primer Guide has been officially published.*

In this guide we introduce you to standards and resources for working with biological data. So first, let's draw a circle around what we mean when we say biological data.  

> Biological data is any information that tells us something about living things—what they are, where they are, how many there are, or how they are functioning. It can come from direct observations (like counting birds or collecting plant samples), from measurements of their traits (like DNA sequences or chemical markers in tissues), or from indirect signals that reflect biological activity (like acoustic recordings of animal calls, pigments that reveal plankton growth, or satellite images showing vegetation health). We choose to focus on biological data that are relevant to understanding our planet and its ecosystems. The data from fields like biomedical, social, and economic sciences may overlap with what we discuss here, but those areas are beyond the scope of this guide.

To paraphrase the [MARCO-BOLO Project Data Management Plan](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8208410), a primary challenge with biological data is that it comes in many flavors. For example, it may include evidence of past or present organisms based on physical samples, chemicals, organic molecules, sound, or images. By using standards to organize and share data efficiently, biologists can turn this variety of data types into a strength rather than a challenge when dealing with biological data.

### This Primer Guide

The lists of standards discussed in these Primer guidelines is not comprehensive and is based on the standards included in the original Primer. If you would like to recommend standards for inclusion in future versions, please see the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ESIPFed/bds-primer-best-practices).

### Audience

The target audience for this Primer Guide is anyone interested in working with biological data, from data collection, to data sharing, and data management. We hope this Primer Guide will provide useful context for using biological standards.

## Key Values

In designing this guide, we focused on a few key values.

{{< fa solid person-hiking size=2xl >}} Helping People Climb: We want to help people find resources about data standards. We were students once too; we know how rarely this value is held within a conventional science education.

{{< fa solid arrows-spin size=2xl  >}} Always Feeding Back: Information and standards develop too quickly to regularly publish guidance in a journal. You can let us know immediately what isn't working or what is wrong via GitHub issues. We're excited to collaborate with you to improve this guide!

{{< fa solid magnifying-glass size=2xl  >}} Transparent: Sometimes resources are confusing until you understand the journey of how it was created. Having experienced this ourselves, we want to share the conversations that helped us build this guide.

### Background on the Cluster

The [ESIP Biological Data Standards Cluster](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Biological_Data_Standards_Cluster) formed in 2020 to maximize data relevance and utility for understanding changes in biodiversity over time. The cluster’s focus has expanded to include more aspects of biology beyond biodiversity, acknowledging that biological data may be useful for many facets of Earth science. To accomplish this, the cluster encourages awareness and shared understanding of biological data standards by facilitating community building and information sharing via guidance, documentation, and training for the biological data community.
