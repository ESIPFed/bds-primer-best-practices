# Integrate Your Data with Other Data

Biodiversity data are collected and managed in many different systems and environments from museum collections, to environmental monitoring programs, research programs, or community science projects (e.g. iNaturalist). Data are often heterogeneous within and across these systems, depending on research objectives, but there are consistent themes in them: the what, where, and when. Although the details may have names unique to your own data, there are specific field names to use to provide these details in a way that aligns with others’ data. Through the use of common terminology, downstream users can not only better search for and discover data, but also evaluate, integrate, and compare datasets.

## Climate and Forecast (CF)

### What Is It:

The [Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions](https://cfconventions.org) provide a framework to clarify details about the context of each piece of data: a description of what the data in each variable represents and their spatial and temporal properties. Although CF is well-established, it is imperfect for biological data, but terms from CF are often applicable in biological data. CF units are specified using the [UDUNITS system](https://cfconventions.org/faq.html#units-in-cf-udunits). CF conventions are built on top of the [netCDF (Network Common Data Form) standard](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/netcdf/) and promote the processing and sharing of netCDF files created with the [NetCDF](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/whatsnetCDF.html) API, so standards like [COARDS conventions](https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html) are applied.

For more information, see overviews of CF as a [presentation](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-documents/overview/viewgraphs.pdf) and [paper](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-documents/overview/article.pdf).

### Why?

-   CF enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable.

-   It facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. 

-   A CF principle is self-contained, meaning as general and well-defined as possible, so the reader does not have to access outside sources to understand the terms.

-   There are many efforts that use CF, including the [National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) and [NASA EarthData](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) repositories. For a longer list, please see [here](https://cfconventions.org/projects-activities.html).

-   The [NERC Vocabulary Server](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/) hosts CF and maps it to other vocabularies. 

### **Top Resources**

1.  To find standard names that describe your data, open up the latest [Standard Name table](https://cfconventions.org/vocabularies.html) (as HTML or XML) and search through it for words typically used for your data.

2.  CF is developed and maintained by the community using GitHub. To propose changes, ask questions, see the [CF GitHub repositories](https://github.com/cf-convention).

## Darwin Core

### What Is It: 

[Dublin Core](https://esipfed.github.io/bds-primer-best-practices/MAKE_YOUR_DATA_INTERNET_READY.html#dublin-core) is a set of metadata terms used by libraries to describe physical and digital resources. 

Darwin Core (DwC) is a glossary of terms…

The Darwin Core archive is a set of interlinked tables…

Darwin Core is a data standard that offers a stable, straightforward and flexible framework for compiling biodiversity data from varied and variable sources. Darwin Core is an extension of Dublin Core for biodiversity informatics. The standard was originally developed by the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG, formerly known as the Taxonomic Database Working Group) community, and it is currently maintained by the Darwin Core Maintenance Interest Group; feedback and participation in development is open to the public. It includes a glossary of terms intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing identifiers, labels and definitions, and improving data reuse in a variety of contexts. In short, it maps information from multiple sources/institutions in a cohesive way for the broader community. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information. Taxonomic occurrence data can be standardized to Darwin Core irrespective of the observing method by which the data were collected (e.g., observational data, genomics, imaging, animal tracking). Through the use of common terminology and controlled vocabularies, downstream users can more easily discover, search, evaluate, integrate and compare datasets.

### Why?

Biodiversity data, be it in museum collections, environmental monitoring programs, research programs or civic science projects (e.g. iNaturalist), is collected and managed in many different systems and environments. Additionally, the data is often very heterogeneous within and across these systems, depending on research objectives. Formatting data to the Darwin Core standard plays a fundamental role in facilitating open-access biodiversity data sharing, use and reuse. 

People collect data in all sorts of ways, but there are consistent aspects of those: the what, where, and when, and then details of those. Aligning your data allows users to put all of these disparate collection methods together. The data you collect has details with names you've given them, but there are equivalents with specific names that you can give them to align them.

### Key Information (How / What)

In practice, adopting the Darwin Core standard revolves around a standard file format, the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A). This is the biodiversity informatics data standard that uses the Darwin Core terms to produce a data record for biodiversity data. Essentially, DwC-A is a compressed (.zip) file that contains interconnected text (e.g. csv or tsv) files that enables data publishers to share data using common terminology. These data files are logically arranged in a star-like manner, and typically consist of a core file with one or more extension files, connected through the use of primary and foreign keys. 

Aside from text data tables, a DwC-A contains .xml files that facilitate human- and machine-interpretation of the data. A descriptor file (meta.xml) describes the contents of the compressed file, as well as the relationships between the core and any extensions. An eml.xml file describes the datasets contained in the DwC-A.
