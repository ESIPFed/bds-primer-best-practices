### **Topic:** Climate and Forecast

##### What is it: 

The Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions are designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) [API (Application Programming Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. Said more plainly, the conventions explain the extra information (metadata) that clearly describes what each piece of data means and when and where it was collected.

##### Why? 

This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities. CF is well-established, although not perfect for biology. Still, biological standards, and other standards, should consider terms from CF that can be used, before reinventing the wheel.

##### Key Information (How / What)

-   [Version 1.0](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.0/build/cf-conventions.html) was released in October 2003, we are now on version 1.12

-   CF is a convention built on top of the netCDF standard, and it generalizes and extends the netCDF [COARDS conventions](https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html).

-   Like DwC requires knowledge of the EML standard, CF requires knowledge of others standards. Because CF is a netCDF convention, it assumes the netCDF standard is being followed. And it relies on the UDUNITS system of specifying units (see [Units in CF (UDUNITS)](https://cfconventions.org/faq.html#units-in-cf-udunits) below).

-   a CF principle is to be self-contained. So for example the CF Standard Names attempt to be as general and well-defined as possible, so the reader does not have to access outside sources to understand the terms.

-   To find standard names that describe your data, open up the latest [Standard Name table](https://cfconventions.org/vocabularies.html) (as HTML or XML) and search through it for words typically used for your data

-   The NERC Vocabulary Server hosts CF, and maintains mappings from CF to other vocabularies. They decompose them into more useful SKOS level semantics. For example: <https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/map/?vocab=P07>

    -   The NERC Vocabulary server is a platform for searching and browsing vocabularies relating to a variety of domains. NERC hosts a collection of vocabularies, including the Climate and Forecast (CF) vocabulary, and provides an interface for searching for terms across all the hosted vocabularies.
