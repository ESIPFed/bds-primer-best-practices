# Make Your Data Internet Ready

Web services and standards are useful to understand if you collect or manage biological data. Platforms like NOAAâ€™s [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/), [NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/), [OBIS](https://manual.obis.org/access.html#api), and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), etc. utilize standard web services to serve data. Web-friendly data standards facilitate the transfer and handling of data via web services by making information visible in a predictable way, promoting online sharing, programmatic discovery, access, and processing of data across platforms and disciplines.Â 

## **Web-enabled standards**

Web standards are the formal, non-proprietary standards and other technical specifications that define and describe different aspects of the World Wide Web. Web standards are created by standards bodies, which are institutions that invite groups of people to come together and agree on how the technologies should work in the best way to fulfill specific use cases. Web standards are key to global data discovery.

### 5.1.1 W3C standards

### What Is It?

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops the [W3C standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/), which serve as building blocks to build internet browsers, web pages, blogs, search engines, and other software that power our experience on the web. Although HTML is its cornerstone, W3C publishes a [range of technical reports](https://www.w3.org/TR/), which help move the web forward, like CSS, SVG, WOFF, WebRTC, XML, and a growing variety of APIs.

### **Why?**

-   Developers can create interactive experiences available on any device.

-   Data can be made more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) by increasing your awareness of these standards.

### **Top Resources**

-   [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) offers a variety of tutorials for free

### 5.1.2 Dublin Core Standard

### **What Is It?**

[Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/) is a metadata standard of 15 â€˜coreâ€™ terms originally developed for archives and libraries to describe physical or digital resources and details about their collection. [Darwin Core](https://esipfed.github.io/bds-primer-best-practices/INTEGRATE_DATA.html#topic-darwin-core) is an extension of Dublin Core for biodiversity information.

-   [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative documentation](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/)

### 5.1.3 DataCite

### **What Is It?**

The [DataCite metadata schema](https://datacite.org/) is an international, not-for-profit organization which aims to improve data citation through web-enabled standards that connect products and citations.Â 

### **Why?**

-   Helps mint persistent identifiers, such as digital object identifiers (DOI), for research products, which enables data archiving and long-term preservation

-   Helps connect the research product to researchers through other persistent identifiers, such as ORCIDs for researchers or ROR for organizations

-   Promotes long-term preservation, accessibility, reuse, and attribution of research products with citable contributions to a scholarly record

-   Connects users and publishing machinery

### **Top Resources**

-   [REST API](https://support.datacite.org/reference/introduction), which enables retrieval, creation, and update of a DOI metadata record.

-   [Additional documentation](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-commons) on DataCite

### 5.1.4 Schema.org

### **What Is It?**

[Schema.org](https://schema.org/) provides documentation on a set of extensible schemas, which are schemas where users can use components to create other schemas. This enables users to embed structured data on their web pages to help search engines understand the information presented and provide richer search results. Using schema.org vocabulary as well as various formats (e.g., JSON-LD) to mark up website content with metadata about itself, makes it easier for websites or data records to not only be searched but also for the relationships between them to be understood.

### **Why?**

-   Make your research more easily and prominently discvoerable through major search engines.

### **Top Resources**

-   You can add schema.org markup to your webpages or records using various online tools, including [Googleâ€™s Structured Data Markup Helper](https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/u/0/), or by directly adding code to your webpages.Â

## Web Services

Web services run much of our digital world today. You probably use them through your phone every day, without noticing a thing. You can think of a web service as a waiter at a restaurant. You (the user) order food (a request), the waiter (the web service) takes your order to the kitchen (the server or application), and then brings you back your food (the response). This allows different parts of a computer system or different systems altogether to interact without needing to know how each other works internally. When web services are fully utilized, it results in impressive hi-speed analysis, like the analytics shared during football (all types ðŸ™‚) games, the olympics, and other sporting events.

### 5.2.1 ERDDAPâ„¢ Web Service

### **What Is It?**

[ERDDAPâ„¢](https://erddap.github.io/) (pronounced ur-dap) is a data server designed to make it easy to access and work with scientific datasets, especially oceanographic and atmospheric data. It provides a simple, consistent way to download, integrate, analyze, and visualize data from many sources. To help compare across datasets, ERDDAPâ„¢ standardizes the space/time axes, so users can set constraints without worrying about the original file format. Users can request just a subset of a dataset and then download it in their preferred formatâ€”such as CSV, JSON, NetCDF, and moreâ€”making ERDDAPâ„¢ a flexible tool for customizing data to fit their needs.

### **Why?**

-   ERDDAPâ„¢ is free, open source, and used globally

-   All information, data, and figures made available via ERDDAPâ„¢ are also available via an API, making data programmatically accessible.

-   ERDDAPâ„¢ has a [RESTful web service](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/erddap/rest.html) which is designed to be easy for computer programs and scripts to use or interact with.

-   Used for oceanographic and atmospheric datasets, but also works great for biological and biodiversity-relevant observations

-   Good for both gridded and tabular data - See table dataset API docs [here](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html), and for gridded datasets [here](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/documentation.html).

-   [Overview: Distributed Model Data Access](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/distributed-data-access)

-   Data providers can [set up their own ERDDAP server](https://erddap.github.io/setup.html) to serve up their data.

-   Additional overall documentation on ERDDAP can be found [here](https://erddap.github.io/).Â Â 

### 5.2.2 Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS)

### **What Is It?**

The [THREDDS](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/tds/) server, which was developed prior to ERDDAP, has features and interfaces that makes it easier to explore and use data.Â 

### **Why?**

-   Biologists usually bump into THREDDS when they need to download large environmental datasets; like climate model outputs, ocean circulation fields, or satellite products; because many data centers use THREDDS catalogs to serve those files. If a biologist wants to go a step further and overlay sea surface temperature maps directly in QGIS to compare with marine protected areas, THREDDS is especially useful since it can provide WMS map services that plug right into GIS tools. By contrast, they often turn to ERDDAP when they want to slice, query, or subset those same datasets for just their study region or species, since ERDDAP makes that kind of filtering and export to CSV or JSON much easier.

### 5.2.3 Web Map Service

### **What Is It?**

A Web Map Service (WMS) is a way to retrieve georegistered map images over the internet to display in applications and web pages. The WMS specifications were developed by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/wms/) to enable interoperability and use in web browsers, open-source GIS software (ex. [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/)), and proprietary GIS software (ex. [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)).

### **Why?**

-   WMS allows you to view and use maps from different sources that host the maps and data used to create them without needing to download them.
