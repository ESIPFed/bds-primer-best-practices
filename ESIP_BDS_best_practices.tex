\emph{This was last updated after the \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBQEy_-MNYm8SBN-0iY_X2esd6MSM-pZE_MZD6rv0Do/edit\#}{meeting on 2022-12-01}, and all material from those brainstorming sessions were incorporated}

The diversity of biological data, and (seeming) lack of overarching community standards makes working with biological data challenging. Several standards do exist for biological data, however these different data, metadata, and taxonomic standards are confusing for data managers and data users to navigate. The biological data community in the US could benefit from guidance, best practice documentation, training, and community building. The \href{https://wiki.esipfed.org/Biological_Data_Standards_Cluster}{ESIP Biological Data Cluster (BDS)} was formed to tackle these problems.

In short, the will be successful if it:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Increase awareness \& interest in standards
\item
  Create unity/shared vision around biological data standards implementation \& Provide guidance related to biological standards
\item
  Provide opportunities for Knowledge sharing \& coordination
\item
  Provide Connectivity across ESIP
\end{enumerate}

We successfully increased awareness and interest in standards through the creation of the primer, officially called, \href{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16806712.v1}{Biological Observation Data Standardization - A Primer for Data Manager} Our goals have evolved to work toward creating a sample extension of the cluster's primer in the form of a best practice document(s). The target audience for the best practice document(s) are people who are new to working with biological data standards. The best practice document will provide additional detail on the points listed in the primer, focusing on efficient actions that can be taken to standardize data.

\newpage

As an example, we brainstormed the ``Make your data software ready'' section of the primer. Specifically, this includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use non-proprietary formats
\item
  Structure data in tidy/long format
\item
  Follow ISO 8601 for dates
\item
  Match scientific names to a taxonomic authority
\item
  Record latitude and longitude in decimal degrees in WGS84
\item
  Use globally unique identifiers
\end{itemize}

The proposed structure for each best practice module is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Value proposition (Why?)

  List / key information (bulleted)

  References list (max 5)

  Allows data to be useful in perpetuity by ensuring data readability and reusability across multiple platforms.
\item
  To align better with the FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Non-proprietary formats} are supported by more than one developer and can be accessed with different software systems. For example, comma separated values (CSV) format is becoming an increasingly popular non-proprietary format.
\item
  A \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_file_format}{proprietary file format}} is a file format of a company, organization, or individual that contains data that is ordered and stored according to a particular encoding-scheme, designed by the company or organization to be secret or with restricted access, such that the decoding and interpretation of this stored data is easily accomplished only with particular software or hardware that the company itself has developed. There may also be costs associated with it and access may be limited. Examples include \texttt{Microsoft\ Excel\ (xlsx)} and \texttt{ESRI\ shapefiles\ (shp)}.
\item
  Many applications (e.g.~Microsoft Office) allow exporting in multiple formats.

  \item
    Data are as atomic as possible (e.g., don't mix types in field)

  Definition: A taxonomic authority is an internationally recognized, used and actively maintained classification of species.
\item

\item
  List of many authorities can be found here: \url{https://resolver.globalnames.org/data_sources}
\item
  Make yourself aware of the structure, limits, and history of the authority you are using.
\item
  Adopt standard binomial nomenclature, when possible
\item
  When possible, reference the unique identifier in addition to the nomenclature.
\item
  Always save and document the originally recorded name.
\item
  Put notes about identification uncertainty in a separate column.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Users have to know where you collected this data, which requires a latitude, longitude, reference system and uncertainty.
\item
  Decimal-degrees avoids special symbols (\texttt{°} or \texttt{‘}) which is preferable for machine readable formats
\item
  \texttt{WGS84} is a reference coordinate system that is widely used and incorporated in many GPS units and tools, and recognized as a standard by many government agencies.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If possible, encourage data providers to confirm, and record, the WGS84 datum is selected prior to data collection.
\item
  Understand and report the device/instrument uncertainty associated with your coordinates because it affects the usability of your data.
\item
  Consider including the vertical component (altitude, depth, height off bottom, elevation, etc)
\item
  Generally speaking, \texttt{degrees-minutes-seconds\ (DMS)} can be converted to \texttt{decimal-degrees\ (DD)} by:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{DD\ =\ d\ +\ (min/60)\ +\ (sec/3600)}
  \item
    Watch out for mixed formats, like degrees, \texttt{decimal-minutes\ (DDM)}.

\subsection{Why?}\label{why-5}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It can be useful to have unique identifiers to unambiguously identify granules of information, e.g.~dataset, collection, database, taxonomic concept, etc. This will allow users to precisely refer to the data and allow your data to remain identifiable when aggregated with other datasets.
\item
  To be able to uniquely identify a record in your data system or across data systems.
  Useful to create relational databases or merge records.
\item
  Although it increases workload, it safeguards against confusion and inefficiency in the future.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{key-information-5}{%
\subsection{Key Information}\label{key-information-5}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are good reasons to keep an identifier opaque, i.e.~it does not indicate anything about the content of information it points to. However, there are also transparent, or semi-opaque identifiers in use that take advantage of semantics to guide humans as well as machines.
\item
  One way to create a unique identifier is concatenation of sampling event, location, time, enumeration of unique observation or event. (e.g.~\texttt{Station\_95\_Date\_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000})
\item
  Some prefer using opaque identifiers.
  (e.g.~\texttt{10FC9784-B30F-48ED-8DB5-FF65A2A9934E})
\item
  If there is an existing globally unique identifier, it's usually a good idea to use it (i.e.~when using a taxonomic authority like WoRMS and applying their LSID).
\item
  It is important to manage any identifiers you create, if they are not managed by an authority (e.g.~DOIs).
\item
  Important that it be persistent (consider samples possibly moving between institutions)
