# Make Your Data Software Ready

Those sharing or managing data can take small steps to make them “software ready.” These include using non-proprietary formats, structuring tables with specific columns and entries, including standards for information about time, place, and organism.

## Use non-proprietary formats

### What is it?

Non-proprietary file formats do not require specific software and can be accessed without licenses and within different software systems. For example, comma separated values (CSV) format is becoming an increasingly popular non-proprietary format compared to the proprietary .xlsx format.

### Why?

-   Allows data to be useful in perpetuity by ensuring data readability and reusability across multiple platforms

-   Aligns better with the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

-   Supports [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).

-   Many applications (e.g. Microsoft Office) allow exporting into multiple formats, which makes it easy to share data in non-proprietary formats even if it was created using proprietary software.

## Structure tabular data in tidy/long format

### What is it?

Long (or sometimes called “tidy”) format for tabular data can best be described as having one observation per row.

The following example shows two different formats – wide and long – of the same data. Notice that while sites 1, 2, and 3 are the column names filled with counts for each species in the wide format, site and count become the column names in long format.

### Why?

-   The clear structure makes data more machine readable, particularly with commonly-used analytical software.

-   Data are as atomic as possible (e.g. no mixed types in one field)

-   It is easier to aggregate data across multiple files


| **species**     | **site_01** | **site_02** | **site_03** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Tilia americana | 4           | 2           | 4           |
| Pinus strobus   | 3           | 3           | 3           |

## Follow ISO 8601 for dates

### What is it?

ISO 8601 is a convention for dates and times, where dates are listed as YYYY-MM-DD and time is given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, Zulu, or GMT) which is the time standard, relative to 0 longitude, that regulates global clocks.

The following table outlines how to write dates, times, and time intervals using ISO 8601:


| **Description** | **Written in ISO 8601** |
|----|----|
| Date | 2023-04-03 |
| Date and Time with timezone offset | 2023-04-03T18:29:38+00:00 |
| Date and Time in UTC | 2023-04-03T18:29:38Z |
| Time Interval in UTC (April 3 - 5, 2023) | 2023-04-03T18:29:38Z/2023-04-05T00:29:38Z |

### Why?

-   Internationally accepted format used across multiple schemas (e.g. `Darwin Core`, `EML`, `ISO 19115`)
-   Removes ambiguity related to timezone, daylight savings time changes, and time of day
-   Better software integration of time date/time elements

## Match scientific names to a taxonomic authority

### **What is it?**

A taxonomic authority is defined here as an online resource that maintains up-to-date species-level classification information and provides persistent identifiers (ID) for taxonomic classifications.

Example: For the species Balaenoptera borealis (Lesson, 1828), the WoRMS taxonomic authority ID link is <https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=137088> and the Life Science Identifier (LSID) is urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:137088.

::: {.callout-note}
## Some important considerations

-   Consider where you want to publish your data and use the existing taxonomic authority (e.g. [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/), [Integrated Taxonomic Information System](https://itis.gov/), [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy)) used in that repository

-   Include the authority who manages said information in your metadata.

-   Make yourself aware of the structure, limits, and history of the authority you are using.

-   Adopt standard binomial nomenclature, when possible.

-   When possible, reference the unique identifier in addition to the nomenclature.

-   If possible, save and document the originally recorded name.

-   Put notes about identification uncertainty in a separate column.

-   Many authorities have APIs to facilitate matching names to identifiers.

:::


### Why?

-   To integrate or aggregate datasets, we need a common frame of reference for taxonomic name
-   Provides an anchor for the taxonomy as scientific understanding evolves. We get more into that over in [section 4](INTEROPERABLE_DATA.qmd).

## Record latitude and longitude in decimal degrees in WGS84

### What is it?

WGS84 is a coordinate reference system that clarifies location. Recording latitude and longitude coordinates in decimal degrees (DD), rather than degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) or decimal-minutes (DM or DDM) standardizes them to be more machine and human readable. Degrees West and South are negative in decimal degrees, and longitude can range from -180 to 180, and longitude -90 to 90. Below are example coordinates in each format. Once locations are recorded in DD, the number of decimal places included should be adjusted to match the precision of the observation.


| **Format**                          | **Example**   |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| Decimal Degrees (DD)                | 30.50833333   |
| Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS)       | 30° 15' 10 N  |
| Degrees Decimal Minutes (DM or DDM) | 30° 15.1667 N |

![https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/coordinate_precision.png](images/coordinate_precision.png)

### Why?

-   Users have to know where you collected this data, which requires a latitude, longitude, reference system and uncertainty.
-   Decimal-degrees avoids special symbols (`°` or `‘`) which is preferable for machine readable formats
-   `WGS84` is a reference coordinate system that is widely used and incorporated in many GPS units and tools, and recognized as a standard by many government agencies.

## Use persistent unique identifiers

### What is it?

Persistent unique identifiers (PIDs) are globally unique identifiers to unambiguously identify granules of information in a machine-readable way. Identifiers can exist in acquired data, or they may be created. When persistent unique identifiers from authorities exist, they should be used (e.g., when using a taxonomic authority like WoRMS). If PIDs are created, the user is responsible for managing them (e.g. DOIs).

PIDs can capture details about the underlying sampling event (e.g., the PID `Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000` is comprised of the time and place of sampling), or they can be opaque (i.e., not indicating anything about the content, e.g., the `PID 10FC9784-B30F-48ED-8DB5-FF65A2A9934E`), or semi-opaque. There are sometimes good reasons to keep an identifier opaque, but transparent or semi-opaque identifiers can guide humans as well as machines.

### Why?

-   To be able to uniquely identify a record in your data system or across data systems, it is important that it be persistent (consider samples possibly moving between institutions).
-   Although it increases workload, it safeguards against confusion and inefficiency in the future.
-   Maintains consistency through change, whether moving samplings between institutions, creating relational databases, or merging records.
-   Allows users to precisely refer to data
