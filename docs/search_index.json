Several standards do exist for biological data, however these different data, metadata, and taxonomic standards are confusing for data managers and data users to navigate. The biological data community in the US could benefit from guidance, best practice documentation, training, and community building. The ESIP Biological Data Cluster (BDS) was formed to tackle these problems. In short, the will be successful if it: Increase awareness &amp; interest in standards Create unity/shared vision around biological data standards implementation &amp; Provide guidance related to biological standards Provide opportunities for Knowledge sharing &amp; coordination Provide Connectivity across ESIP We successfully increased awareness and interest in standards through the creation of the primer, officially called, Biological Observation Data Standardization - A Primer for Data Manager Our goals have evolved to work toward creating a sample extension of the cluster’s primer in the form of a best practice document(s). The target audience for the best practice document(s) are people who are new to working with biological data standards. The best practice document will provide additional detail on the points listed in the primer, focusing on efficient actions that can be taken to standardize data. As an example, we brainstormed the “Make your data software ready” section of the primer. Specifically, this includes: Use non-proprietary formats Structure data in tidy/long format Follow ISO 8601 for dates Match scientific names to a taxonomic authority Record latitude and longitude in decimal degrees in WGS84 Use globally unique identifiers The proposed structure for each best practice module is: Value proposition (Why?)

Allows data to be useful in perpetuity by ensuring data readability and reusability across multiple platforms. To align better with the FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability) Makes data more socially equitable, supporting open science. Proprietary formats can depend on software that require licenses, which not everyone can afford/has access to. 6.1.2 Key Information Non-proprietary formats are supported by more than one developer and can be accessed with different software systems. For example, comma separated values (CSV) format is becoming an increasingly popular non-proprietary format. A proprietary file format is a file format of a company, organization, or individual that contains data that is ordered and stored according to a particular encoding-scheme, designed by the company or organization to be secret or with restricted access, such that the decoding and interpretation of this stored data is easily accomplished only with particular software or hardware that the company itself has developed. There may also be costs associated with it and access may be limited. Examples include Microsoft Excel (xlsx) and ESRI shapefiles (shp). Many applications (e.g. Microsoft Office) allow exporting in multiple formats. 6.1.3 Top 5 References Table of commonly used formats for common data types https://guides.osu.edu/c.php?g=707751&amp;p=5027409 A more detailed table that is specific to US Federal records management https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance-tables.html 6.2 Structure tabular data in tidy/long format 6.2.1 Why? This is specifically intended for tabular data There is a clear and easy to understand structure that can make your data more machine readable and easier to analyze/visualize Clear structure: one observation per row Data are as atomic as possible (e.g., don’t mix types in field) In the biological data community, tidy formats are more likely to work with commonly-used software Easier to aggregate data across multiple files 6.2.2 Key Information ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union Table 6.1: Wide Format (left) vs. Long Format (right) species site_01 site_02 site_03 Tilia americana 0 3 2 Pinus strobus 1 4 4 species site count Tilia americana site_01 0 Tilia americana site_02 3 Tilia americana site_03 2 Pinus strobus site_01 1 Pinus strobus site_02 4 Pinus strobus site_03 4 Can be tricky working with multiple column datatypes Don’t use colors or text formatting in tabular data, and only include column names as metadata. All other notes, definitions, etc. should be in an external metadata file (e.g. data dictionary) 6.2.3 Top 5 References Wickham, H. (2014). Tidy Data.

Internationally accepted format used across multiple schemas (e.g. Darwin Core, EML, ISO 19115) Removes ambiguity related to timezone, daylight savings time changes, and time of day Better software integration of time date/time elements 6.3.2 Key Information UTC (AKA Zulu or GMT): Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is time relative to 0° longitude and is not adjusted for daylight saving time. (from Wikipedia). Conversion to UTC, or between time zones, may depend on daylight savings Examples: April 3, 2023 standardized to ISO 8601 Description Written.in.ISO.8601 Date 2023-04-03 Date and Time with timezone offset 2023-04-03T18:29:38+00:00 Date and Time in UTC 2023-04-03T18:29:38Z Time Interval in UTC (April 3 - 5, 2023) 2023-04-03T18:29:38Z/2023-04-05T00:29:38Z Description Example Annotation Date and Time with timezone offset 2023-04-03T18:29:38+00:00 YYYY-MM-DD[the letter capital T]HH:MM:SS+[Timezone offset] Date and Time in UTC 2023-04-03T18:29:38Z YYYY-MM-DD[capital T]HH:MM:SS+[capital Z to indicate an offset of zero] 6.3.3 Top 5 References ISO 8601 wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 R package lubridate, OlsonNames() Python go-to package, datetime https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html Article on datetime uncertainty: https://www.datafix.com.au/BASHing/2020-02-12.html Map of offset from UTC: https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/ Nice time converter: https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/convert/time.html 6.4 Match scientific names to a taxonomic authority 6.4.1 Why? Definition: A taxonomic authority is an internationally recognized, used and actively maintained classification of species. To integrate or aggregate datasets, we have to have a common frame of reference for taxonomic name Provides an anchor for the taxonomy as scientific understanding evolves. 6.4.2 Key Information Use an existing taxonomic authority (e.g. World Register of Marine Species , Integrated Taxonomic Information System , NCBI taxonomy) and include the authority who manages said information in your metadata List of many authorities can be found here: https://resolver.globalnames.org/data_sources Make yourself aware of the structure, limits, and history of the authority you are using. Adopt standard binomial nomenclature, when possible When possible, reference the unique identifier in addition to the nomenclature. Always save and document the originally recorded name. Put notes about identification uncertainty in a separate column. Many authorities have APIs through which you can match names to identifiers. 6.4.3 Top 5 References R packages taxize is a taxonomic toolbelt for R. taxize wraps APIs for a large suite of taxonomic databases available on the web https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxize/index.html worrms is an API client for World Register of Marine Species http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/worrms/vignettes/worrms_vignette.html worms: another API client for WoRMS https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/worms/index.html Ritis: API client for ITIS https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ritis/ Python packages WoRMS API client https://github.com/iobis/pyworms Global Names Resolver to compare taxonomic concepts across authorities https://resolver.globalnames.org/ Article: Recommendations for the Standardisation of Open Taxonomic Nomenclature for Image-Based Identifications https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.620702 TDWG 2022 Keynote: Richard Pyle, “An Introduction to the Scientific Names of Organisms and the Taxon Concepts they Represent” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmTvUUjBxrI 6.5 Record latitude and longitude in decimal degrees in WGS84 Figure 6.2: https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/coordinate_precision.png 6.5.1 Why? Users have to know where you collected this data, which requires a latitude, longitude, reference system and uncertainty. Decimal-degrees avoids special symbols (° or ‘) which is preferable for machine readable formats WGS84 is a reference coordinate system that is widely used and incorporated in many GPS units and tools, and recognized as a standard by many government agencies. 6.5.2 Key Information If possible, encourage data providers to confirm, and record, the WGS84 datum is selected prior to data collection. Understand and report the device/instrument uncertainty associated with your coordinates because it affects the usability of your data. Consider including the vertical component (altitude, depth, height off bottom, elevation, etc) Generally speaking, degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) can be converted to decimal-degrees (DD) by: DD = d + (min/60) + (sec/3600) Watch out for mixed formats, like degrees, decimal-minutes (DDM). Degrees West and South become negative in DD. Values for longitude range from -180 to 180, inclusive. Values for latitude range from -90 to 90, inclusive. Format Example Decimal Degrees (DD) 30.50833333 Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) 30° 15’ 10 N Degrees Decimal Minutes (DM or DDM) 30° 15.1667 N 6.5.3 Top 5 References Existing R/python/ESRI packages/functions R - measurements https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/measurements/measurements.pdf EML https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/index.html (find “bounding Coordinates) CF https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html#latitude-coordinate Getting lat/lon to decimal degrees https://ioos.github.io/bio_mobilization_workshop/03-data-cleaning/index.html#getting-latlon-to-decimal-degrees Some background on precision https://www.trekview.org/blog/2021/reading-decimal-gps-coordinates-like-a-computer/#a-note-on-accuracy https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/8650/measuring-accuracy-of-latitude-and-longitude DMS to DD calculator https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/dms-decimal 6.6 Use persistent unique identifiers 6.6.1 Why? It can be useful to have unique identifiers to unambiguously identify granules of information, e.g. dataset, collection, database, taxonomic concept, etc. This will allow users to precisely refer to the data and allow your data to remain identifiable when aggregated with other datasets. To be able to uniquely identify a record in your data system or across data systems. Useful to create relational databases or merge records. Although it increases workload, it safeguards against confusion and inefficiency in the future. 6.6.2 Key Information There are good reasons to keep an identifier opaque, i.e. it does not indicate anything about the content of information it points to. However, there are also transparent, or semi-opaque identifiers in use that take advantage of semantics to guide humans as well as machines. One way to create a unique identifier is concatenation of sampling event, location, time, enumeration of unique observation or event. (e.g. Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000) Some prefer using opaque identifiers. (e.g. 10FC9784-B30F-48ED-8DB5-FF65A2A9934E) If there is an existing persistent unique identifier, it’s usually a good idea to use it (i.e. when using a taxonomic authority like WoRMS and applying their LSID). It is important to manage any identifiers you create, if they are not managed by an authority (e.g. DOIs). Important that it be persistent (consider samples possibly moving between institutions) Type of PID Use Case Example Digital Object Identifier (DOI) Actionable persistent link for papers, data, and other digital objects https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16806712.v2 International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) Persistent identifier for physical samples http://igsn.org/AU1243 Life Science Identifier (LSID) Persistent structured method for biologically significant data urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:218214 Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) Persistent actionable link for individuals https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4391-107X 6.6.3 Top 5 References Software and Packages to generate uuids: R - uuid https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/uuid/index.html python - uuid https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html http://guid.one/ https://guidgenerator.com/ Guidance on how to use GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) to meet specific requirements of the biodiversity information community http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/guid-applicability-final-2011-01.pdf Use of globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) to link herbarium specimen records to physical specimens https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aps3.1027 A Beginner’s Guide to Persistent Identifiers http://links.gbif.org/persistent_identifiers_guide_en_v1.pdf "]]
