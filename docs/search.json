    "text": "ESIP BDS Primer Guide Suite of Documents\nThe ESIP Biological Data Standards Cluster formed in 2020 to maximize data relevance and utility for understanding changes in biodiversity over time. To accomplish this the cluster facilitates guidance, best practice documentation, training, and community building for the US biological data community. The first product from this cluster Biological Data Standards Primer, while an easy to digest resource, does not provide the context data managers need to decide which standards to use for the data they are working with. The guides are intended to be a bridge between the full, lengthy standards documentation, and the short primer quick reference. The first document being developed is for the “Make Your Data Software Ready?” section of the primer.\n\nHow to contribute\nIf you would like to suggest changes or additions to the current version of the best practice documents, please use the GitHub issues to document your request. The current draft can be seen as a rendered webpage here.\n\n\nStructure\nThe structure for each section is:\n\nValue proposition (Why?)\nList / key information (bulleted)\nReferences list"

At its most basic, it is written in narrative form with class diagrams. There are many implementations and extensions (e.g., https://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/iso-19115).\n\n\n1.2.2 Why?\n\nProvide context to your data (biological data is inherently ‘geographic’)\nStandardized representation of information\nMandated by some US federal agencies, including NOAA, NASA, and USGS\nCan be used at different granularities, used to describe data packages or collections, as well as at a dataset level (?): content standard vs collection standard?\n\n\n\n1.2.3 What?\n\nEvolved from the need for to to harmonize the FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM) with other formal and defacto standards that support the documentation of geospatial data and services.\nMany variations including 19115, 19115-1, 19115-2\nFrom NCEI:\n\nISO 19115 Geographic information – Metadata: The ISO standard for documenting geospatial data. \nISO 19115-2 Geographic information – Metadata – Part 2: Extensions for imagery and gridded data: An extension of ISO 19115 used to document information about imagery, gridded data, and remotely sensed data. The root of ISO 19115 metadata records will change from MD_Metadata to MI_Metadata when using ISO 19115-2. \n\nThere is a biological extension (https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/handle/11329/1281?show=full), but it is not very widely used.  In part this is because many search engines do not harvest this extension.\nUsurped FGDC CSDGM - all users encouraged to migrate to ISO.\nHighly flexible for many uses compared FGDC CSDGM, but few required elements leaves room for incomplete metadata\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Top References\n\nNOAA Workbook for ISO 19115-2 https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/ISO%2019115-2%20Workbook_Part%20II%20Extentions%20for%20imagery%20and%20Gridded%20Data.pdf \nConvert ISO to EML - https://nceas.github.io/arcticdatautils/reference/convert_iso_to_eml.html \nWork Flow Model -\nhttps://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/iso-implementation-model-workflow \nmdToolkit: https://www.mdtoolkit.org/home - mdEditor is a writer for ISO 19115 metadata which uses mdJSON as an intermediary and mdTranslator allows translation to different metadata formats"

    "section": "Use persistent unique identifiers",
    "text": "Use persistent unique identifiers\n\nWhy?\n\nIt can be useful to have unique identifiers to unambiguously identify granules of information, e.g. dataset, collection, database, taxonomic concept, etc. This will allow users to precisely refer to the data and allow your data to remain identifiable when aggregated with other datasets.\nTo be able to uniquely identify a record in your data system or across data systems. Useful to create relational databases or merge records.\nAlthough it increases workload, it safeguards against confusion and inefficiency in the future.\n\n\n\nKey Information\n\nThere are good reasons to keep an identifier opaque, i.e. it does not indicate anything about the content of information it points to. However, there are also transparent, or semi-opaque identifiers in use that take advantage of semantics to guide humans as well as machines.\nOne way to create a unique identifier is concatenation of sampling event, location, time, enumeration of unique observation or event. (e.g. Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000)\nSome prefer using opaque identifiers. (e.g. 10FC9784-B30F-48ED-8DB5-FF65A2A9934E)\nIf there is an existing persistent unique identifier, it’s usually a good idea to use it (i.e. when using a taxonomic authority like WoRMS and applying their LSID).\nIt is important to manage any identifiers you create, if they are not managed by an authority (e.g. DOIs).\nImportant that it be persistent (consider samples possibly moving between institutions)\n\nExamples of PIDs\n\n\n\nType of PIDUse CaseExampleDigital Object Identifier (DOI)Actionable persistent link for papers, data, and other digital objectshttps://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16806712.v2International Geo Sample Number (IGSN)Persistent identifier for physical sampleshttp://igsn.org/AU1243&gt;Life Science Identifier (LSID)Persistent structured method for biologically significant dataurn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:218214Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)Persistent actionable link for individualshttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-4391-107X\n\n\n\n\nTop References\n\nSoftware and Packages to generate uuids:\n\nR - uuid https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/uuid/index.html\npython - uuid https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html\nhttp://guid.one/\nhttps://guidgenerator.com/\n\nGuidance on how to use GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) to meet specific requirements of the biodiversity information community\nhttp://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/guid-applicability-final-2011-01.pdf\nUse of globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) to link herbarium specimen records to physical specimens\nhttps://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aps3.1027\nA Beginner’s Guide to Persistent Identifiers\nhttp://links.gbif.org/persistent_identifiers_guide_en_v1.pdf"
