**What section of the best practices does your suggestion relate to?**
*e.g. section 6.1.2 Use non-proprietary formats: Key Information*

**Short description of content that should be revised**

*e.g. replace with "proprietary formats cannot be supported by more than one developer and/or accessed with multiple software systems." *
