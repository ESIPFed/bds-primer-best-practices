# Make Your Data Interoperable

Controlled vocabularies can provide standardized terms and definitions for biological concepts, like biological taxonomies. Using a controlled vocabulary facilitates the integration and sharing of data across diverse sources, improving consistency and data quality, for example, in species classification.

## Catalogue of Life (COL)

### What Is It?

[Catalogue of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/) describes itself as, “The most complete authoritative list of the world's species - maintained by hundreds of global taxonomists.” It brings together information from taxonomists, and taxonomic databases, to construct an integrated view of currently accepted species across all taxonomic groups. A list of source datasets can be found [here](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/source-datasets). \
\
The primary mission of COL is to deliver data, but the tools and services offered by COL also enable taxonomists and other stakeholders to publish and revise species lists for any purpose.

### **Why?**

-   COL adds persistent identifiers that enable users to track changes to a scientific name. 

-   COL helps downstream users consider the most up-to-date past and current characteristics of an organism: its biology, distribution, relevance to humans, and evolutionary history.

### **Top Resources**

-   Users can browse the [COL Checklist](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/browse), which is updated monthly. COL pulls information from specific data sources, e.g. FishBase (see: <https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/49JFH>).

## Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)

### What Is It?

[ITIS](https://www.itis.gov/) is a taxonomic database, developed and maintained by a partnership of federal agencies that provides reliable information on the nomenclature, taxonomy, and distribution of 1.8 million species of plants, animals, fungi and microbes in North America and the world. ITIS couples each scientific name with a unique taxonomic serial number (TSN), which ensures consistency and accuracy in the naming and classification of species.

### **Why?**

-   Unique taxonomic serial number (TSN) ensures consistent and accurate naming and classification of species

-   ITIS is an important tool for identifying and cataloging species and monitoring their populations.

-   [ITIS website](https://www.itis.gov/) 

-   ITIS [API](https://itis.gov/web_service.html)

## Paleobiology Database (PBDB)

### What Is It?

The [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/) (PBDB) is an online, expert-curated database that aims to provide taxonomic information for paleobiological taxa of all geological ages. It contains data for almost half a million paleobiological taxa from over 900 different contributors.

### Why should you use it?

Checking your paleobiological taxonomic names against the PBDB will ensure the names are up-to-date based on current taxonomic literature. PBDB also provides the taxonomic backbone to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) so aligning your taxonomic names with PBDB will make the process of sharing your data easier.

## How to use it?

PBDB can be accessed via their website, a mobile application, and an API. The PBDB website has a [Resources](https://paleobiodb.org/#/resources) tab where more information about these access points can be found. The same Resources page also includes information on how to contribute taxonomic information to PBDB.

## World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)

### What Is It?

The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) is an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms. In plain language...

### Why should you use it?

One of the reasons WoRMS is highly thought of in the marine community is that the content of WoRMS is curated by taxonomic and thematic experts, not by database managers. Each taxonomic group is represented by an expert who has the authority over the content, and is responsible for controlling the quality of the information. Each of these main taxonomic editors can invite several specialists of smaller groups within their area of responsibility to join them. WoRMS is the taxonomic database used by OBIS, and other important biological initiatives.

### How to use it?

WoRMS, and its associated tools, can be explored through your [web browser](https://www.marinespecies.org/index.php), and through its [API](https://www.marinespecies.org/rest/) using one of the R packages (e.g. [worrms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/worrms/index.html), [taxize](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxize/)) or [python](https://github.com/iobis/pyworms) package.
